# An Introduction to Permutation Groups

## Overview
These notes were prepared for a [six-part seminar series](http://webpages.csus.edu/wiscons/events/ANTC-series-2022.html) on permutation groups in Spring 2022 at California State University, Sacramento. The series was designed to give a casual, example-driven introduction to permutation groups highlighting various core ideas and introducing current research.
Many, many thanks to Meagan Pham for helpful discussions throughout the development of the series and for giving the final talk on relational complexity.
